# The Simple Shell

An implementation of the basic command line interpreter using C.

# Usage

The mini CLI  has usages as those of the Bourne Shell. It has some limitations but it is handy on its implementation.

# Commands

### Change Directory (`cd`)

The `cd` command is built in to allow shifting from the current working directory. Enter `cd [directory]` to navigate the specified directory. Default is current user's `$HOME` directory if `[directory` is ommitted.

### Exit Command 

The `exit` is built to exit the shell
